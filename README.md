In conclusion, the comparative study of a basic 3-layer neural network and a CNN model on classification tasks reveals several key points:

- **Basic Neural Network Performance**:
  - Showed consistent improvement over 20 epochs.
  - Achieved final training and validation accuracies of approximately 94.85% and 91.20%, respectively.
  - Displayed signs of overfitting, with an increase in validation loss over time, suggesting limited generalization to new data.

- **CNN Model Performance**:
  - Demonstrated superior accuracy and stability in loss values.
  - Reached higher training and validation accuracies of about 96.18% and 93.41%, respectively.
  - Utilized convolutional and pooling layers effectively for enhanced feature extraction and learning.

- **Importance of Architecture**:
  - The comparison highlights the significance of choosing the right architecture for neural network performance.
  - CNN’s ability to handle spatial hierarchies in data results in better management of complex patterns, outperforming the basic neural network model.

The findings underscore the necessity of monitoring both accuracy and loss metrics during training to mitigate overfitting and enhance the model’s generalization capabilities. Ultimately, the choice of neural network architecture significantly influences the model's performance and effectiveness in addressing classification challenges.
